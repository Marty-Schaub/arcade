## Description
This classic arcade game project was part of the FEND Grow with Google Scholarship program.  It is a simple arcade game that requires the user move the player (using the up, down, left and right arrows) across the pavement to the water without colliding with the moving bugs.

## Prerequisites
The code for this project is written in html, css and javascript.  It requires a browser that supports ES6 and allows the player's browser to run scripts. It also requires a text/code editor to modify the html, css and javascript files.

## Dependencies

## Installing

## Versioning
